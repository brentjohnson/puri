describes their version of the game. The board layout implemented here is quite similar, so this side may help you get used to 
the user interface

Currently their is only a german version of the game available, as I designed this game just for me. I don't know about
the legal terms of this game, so use it on your own risk.

You may play this game with 3 to 5 players in a hot seat session. AI is planned, but not yet implemented. Also the game
is automated as far as possible, so don't be confused if much of the game play works on its own, as for example the
shipping in captains phase. I for myself want to focus on the real decisions while playing and let the system do the rest.
Most of the time playing board games with other people, it's too slow for me. This implementation is the opposite and may
be too fast for you.

Enjoy playing and feel free to give feedback!
